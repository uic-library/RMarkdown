-------------------------------------------
This workshop will provide an introduction to R Markdown documents in R which provide a powerful way to combine text and code to create publications and other documents with integrated charts, figures and other code-generated analyses. 

This workshop uses an adapted version of the data paper: Nitsch, F. J., Sellitto, M., & Kalenscher, T. (2021). The effects of acute and chronic stress on choice consistency. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 131, 105289. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105289. The data paper along with its underlying data publicly available at: https://osf.io/6mvq7 were adapted and used for educational purposes with authors' permission.
